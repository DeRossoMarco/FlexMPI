# Example of Application File
# Each uncommented line corresponds to an application
# Format: num_processes:matrix_size:CPU_intensity:communication_intensity:IO_intensity:IO_action:Num_iterations
#       If IO_action<0, the program performs MPI I/O calls
#       If IO_action>=0,the program sleeps IO_action during the I/O call

#Application 1
jacobi:2:5000:2:1:1:2.5:2000

#Application 2
#cg:2:5000:2:1:1:2.5:2000

#Application 3 (uncomment to execute)
#epigraph:4:7000:1:1:1:2:3000
